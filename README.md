Stove's Guix Config Pile
===

This is a configuration repository meant to share Guix configs amongst myself and any others insane enough to use Guix for every-day drivers.

* `/devices` - for my physical computational hardware
* `/home` - for use with `guix home`, the Home env manager tool
* `/home/dotfiles` - dotfiles to be used by `guix home` (or other stuff)

(p.s. don't tell my [nixfiles](https://github.com/sleibrock/nixfiles) about this repo please, they will get very upset)
