;; Steven's .emacs files w/ explanations
;;
;; Goal:
;; - provide a reasonable Emacs configuration to my liking
;; - make it easy to share and let others learn from
;; - explain all code snippets and interactions

;; This adds the third party MELPA packaging to our Emacs package system
;; Emacs uses a standard, and very strict packaging site called ELPA
;; sometimes packages don't exist on ELPA and instead exist on MELPA
;; as a community package list. For more extensive packages,
;; check out MELPA and append MELPA to your own Emacs
(require 'package)

;; you can choose to delete this line if it makes emacs too slow
(package-initialize)


;; Defining your deps is important because it aims to reproduce a build
;; that is easy to share and re-use across installations.
(setq deps '(eglot zig-mode spacemacs-theme evil neotree racket-mode

;; Set auto-saves to exist in the home directory (and not with your code)
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs-saves")))

(setq-default tab-width 4)

;; Remove tabs, I hate tabs!!!!!111
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; Emacs doesn't have a great way of installing deps from scratch,
;; so a custom function like this is a little required to use
(defun install-all-deps ()
  "Install all your custom dependencies"
  (interactive) ; mark it as an emacs function
  (package-refresh-contents) ; download fresh pkg lists from mirrors
